Contribution Guideline
------------

In general, our project follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

Each of use fork the repo on GitHub and clone the project to our own machine; then we commit change to our own 
branch and commit changes to our own branch. By submitting a pull request, we merge our branch to main.

TA can check out the pull requests, addition and the java doc of each class that demonstrates the author 
who writes this class.
